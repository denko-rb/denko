      #   - Normal reads perform normal #update behavior, passing through
      #     #pre_callback_filter, running all callbacks and returning filtered_data.
      #     Use normal for anything that updates the state of a component, and handle
      #     that in in #pre_callback_filter and #update_state.
      #     May or may not block calling thread, depending on platform.
      #
      #   - Raw reads bypass #pre_callback_filter, callbacks, and return
      #     raw data. Use raw for reading things like sensor config/serial etc.
      #     DOES NOT take block callbacks from the use. ALWAYS handle the return value.
      #     ALWAYS blocks the calling thread.
