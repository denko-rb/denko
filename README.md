# denko
[![Test Status](https://github.com/denko-rb/denko/actions/workflows/ruby.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/denko-rb/denko/actions/workflows/ruby.yml)

Program real-life electronics in pure Ruby. LEDs, buttons, sensors (and more) work just like any Ruby object:

```ruby
led.blink 0.5

lcd.print "Hello World!"

reading = sensor.read

button.down do
  puts "Button pressed!"
end
```

## How It Works

There are currently two ways to use denko. Both have the same user-friendly API, but the hardware can be very different. Here's a summary of each:

### Connected Microcontroller
- Flash a microcontroller with the denko C firmware, so it can be "remote controlled"
- Run a Ruby program on a "real" computer with the microcontroller connected
- The microcontroller appears as an instance of `Denko::Board`
- Calling methods on it will exchange messages that manipulate the real microcontroller
- The microcontroller can only do the bare minimum to send and receive signals
- Everything from device drivers up happens in Ruby

### Single-Board-Computer
- Install [denko-piboard](https://github.com/denko-rb/denko-piboard) and some dependencies
- Ruby a Ruby program on the SBC
- The SBC's own GPIO header appears as a `Denko::PiBoard` instance
- Everything runs self-contained on the SBC

**Notes:**
- Peripheral classes are only in this gem, but are compatible with both types of board, and both gems.
- That makes the [examples](examples) folder of this gem (mostly) relevant to both gems.
- If using denko-piboard, ignore the hardware and installation sections here.

## Supported Hardware

[Microcontroller & Peripheral Support List](HARDWARE.md)

## Installation

**Note:** On Windows you can follow the Mac/Linux instructions in WSL, but it isn't recommended. Serial (COM port) forwarding isn't working on WSL2, which means you can't communicate with the board. There are workarounds, and it might work on WSL1, but the [RubyInstaller for Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/) and Arduino IDE are recommended instead. A Linux virtual machine with USB passthrough works too.

#### 1. Install the Gem

```console
gem install denko
```

#### 2. Install the Arduino IDE OR CLI

Get the Arduino IDE [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for a graphical interface (recommended for Windows), or use the command line interface from [here](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/releases), or Homebrew.

**CLI Installation with Homebrew on Mac or Linux:**

```console
brew update
brew install arduino-cli
```

#### 3. Install Arduino Dependencies

Denko uses Arduino cores, which support different microcontrollers, and a few libraries. Install only the ones for your microcontroller, or install everything. There are no conflcits. Instructions:

- [Install Dependencies in IDE](DEPS_IDE.md)
- [Install Dependencies in CLI](DEPS_CLI.md)

#### 4. Generate the Arduino Sketch

The `denko` command is included with the gem. It will make the Arduino sketch folder for you, and configure it.

**Example for ESP32 target on both serial and Wi-Fi:**

```console
denko sketch serial --target esp32
denko sketch wifi --target esp32 --ssid YOUR_SSID --password YOUR_PASSWORD

# For more options
denko targets
```

**Note:** Boards flashed with a Wi-Fi or Ethernet sketch will [listen for a TCP connection](examples/connection/tcp.rb), but fall back to Serial when there is none active.

#### 5a. IDE Flashing

- Connect the board to your computer with a USB cable.
- Open the .ino file inside your sketch folder with the IDE.
- Open the dropdown menu at the top of the IDE window, and select your board.
- Press the Upload :arrow_right: button. This will compile the sketch, and flash it to the board.

**Troubleshooting:**

- If your serial port is in the list, but the board is wrong, select the serial port anyway, then you can manually select a board.
- If your board doesn't show up at all, make sure it is connected properly. Try disconnecting and reconnecting, use a different USB port or cable, or press the reset button after plugging it in.
- Some boards can get into a state where you have to hold their "boot" button while cycling power (reconnect or reset) for them to enter firmware update mode. Eg. Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32-S2/S3.

#### 5b. CLI Flashing

- The path output by `denko sketch` earlier is your sketch folder. Keep it handy.
- Connect the board to your computer with a USB cable.
- Check if the CLI recognizes it:

```console
arduino-cli board list
```

- Using the Port and FQBN (Fully Qualified Board Name) shown, compile and upload the sketch:

```console
arduino-cli compile -b YOUR_FQBN YOUR_SKETCH_FOLDER
arduino-cli upload -v -p YOUR_PORT -b YOUR_FQBN YOUR_SKETCH_FOLDER
```

**Troubleshooting:**

- Follow the same steps as the IDE method above. List all FQBNs using:

```console
arduino-cli board listall
```

#### 6. Test It

Most boards have a regular LED on-board. Test with the [blink](examples/led/builtin_blink.rb) example. If you have an on-board WS2812 LED (Neopixel), use the [WS2812 blink](examples/led/ws2812_builtin_blink.rb) example instead. If it starts blinking, you're ready for Ruby!

## Examples and Tutorials

#### Tutorial

- [Here](tutorial) you will find a beginner-friendly tutorial, that goes through the basics, using commented examples and diagrams. Read the comments and try modifying the code. You will need the following:
  - 1 compatible microcontroller (see [supported hardware](HARDWARE.md))
  - 1 button or momentary switch
  - 1 potentiometer (any value)
  - 1 external RGB LED (4 legs common cathode, not a Neopixel or individually addressable)
  - 1 external LED (any color, or use one color from the RGB LED)
  - Current limiting resistors for LEDs
  - Breadboard
  - Jumper wires

  **Tip:** Kits are a good way to get started. They include even more, and get you well beyond the tutorial.

#### Included Examples

- The [examples](examples) folder contains at least one example per peripheral, demonstrating its interface.
- Each example should incldue a wiring diagram alongside its code (still incomplete).
